<div><p>Users can submit their art on our website and it is then stored on our server. When a user requests data from our server, they are served with a work that has a QR code attached. This QR code can then be scanned if they want to know more about the piece of art. The get feature also implements Google Cloud Platform's Machine Learning APIs to provide an explicit content moderation system, as well as giving tags to the data. We do not do this while accepting data, as forms of art can be explicit. However, to protect the user we implement it while giving out data.
